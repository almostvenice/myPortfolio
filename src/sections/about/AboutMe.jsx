I created a script that ran 50 crypto transactions in 10 seconds instead of manually sending them in half an hour every single day. I also set up a telegram bot to automate management of any devices that disconnected or needed a reboot. Being able to build something using logic and math was instilled in me at 16 when I began working with my father in construction. As far as programming, I've taken a HTML/CSS/Javascript course and a Full Stack (MERN) course with Nucamp. Iâ€™m also currently enrolled in the FastTrack program I mentioned earlier and that will be completed in September.</p>
